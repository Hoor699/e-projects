                      <p class="intro-paragraph"> The 7 Wonders of the World are amazing buildings and places made by people a long time ago. These wonders are famous because they show the great skills,
                          hard work, and creativity of humans from different parts of the world. Each wonder has a special story and tells us something about the
                          history and culture of the people who built it.
                          The <strong>Great Wall of China</strong> is a long wall that was built to protect the country. <strong>Petra</strong>, in Jordan, is a city made from 
                          red rock and is known for its beautiful buildings carved into cliffs. In Brazil, the <strong>Christ the Redeemer</strong> statue stands tall with open arms, showing peace and love. The ancient city of <strong>Machu Picchu</strong> in Peru was built high in the mountains by the Inca people and is full of mystery.
                          <strong>Chichen Itza</strong>, in Mexico, was a powerful city of the Mayan people and has a big pyramid used for studying stars.
                          The <strong>Colosseum</strong> in Rome, Italy, is a large stadium where people used to watch fights and shows many years ago. And the beautiful
                          <strong>Taj Mahal</strong> in India is a white marble building built by a king for his beloved wife, and it shows the beauty of love.
                          These 7 wonders are not just old buildings. They are special places that remind us of what humans can create with effort, imagination, and heart.
                          People from all over the world visit these wonders to learn about history and to see their beauty. They are treasures of our world that must be
                          respected and protected.</p>

                            <p>The Great Wall of China is a massive network of walls and fortifications built across northern China over 2,500 years.
                               It was constructed to protect Chinese states from northern invaders and has become one of the most iconic symbols of China.
                               The Great Wall of China is one of the most iconic structures in the world — a massive fortification stretching across thousands 
                               of kilometers in northern China. Built over centuries,
                               it served as both a military defense system and a symbol of Chinese strength and unity.</p>

                             <p>Petra is a historical city carved into red sandstone cliffs. It was a major trading hub of the Nabatean Kingdom around 300 BC.
                              Petra is a famous archaeological site in Jordan's southwestern desert. Dating to around 300 B.C., it was the capital of the Nabatean Kingdom. 
                              Accessed via a narrow canyon called Al Siq, it contains tombs and temples carved into pink sandstone cliffs, earning its nickname, the "Rose City." Perhaps its most famous structure is 45m-high Al Khazneh,
                              a temple with an ornate, Greek-style facade, and known as The Treasury.

                            In the 1850s the Vincentian priest Pedro Maria Boss suggested placing a Christian monument on Mount Corcovado to honour Isabel, 
                            princess regent of Brazil and the daughter of Emperor Pedro II, although the project was never approved. In 1921 the Roman Catholic 
                            archdiocese of Rio de Janeiro proposed that a statue of Christ be built on the 2,310-foot (704-metre) summit, which, because of its commanding 
                            height, would make it  visible from anywhere in Rio. Citizens petitioned Pres. Epitácio Pessoa to allow the construction of the statue on Mount Corcovado.

                            its rediscovery in 1911.The Historic Sanctuary of Machu Picchu[2] is a protected area in Peru covering over 35,000 hectares. It includes the natural environment surrounding the Machu Picchu archaeological site, located in the rugged cloud forest of the Yungas on the eastern slope of the Peruvian Andes and along both banks of the Urubamba River, which flows northwest in this section.
                            This unique protected area encompasses one of the most extraordinary altitudinal transects in Peru, spanning only about twenty kilometers and protecting diverse ecosystems ranging from eternal snows at over 4,000 meters above sea level to tropical rainforests just over 1,700 meters above sea level.</p>

                           <p>This Mayan pyramid complex in Mexico was a major city around AD 600. Its architecture reflects astronomical precision and cultural richness.
                            In 1926, the Mexican government charged Edward Thompson with theft, claiming he stole the artifacts from the Cenote Sagrado and smuggled them out of the country. 
                            The government seized the Hacienda Chichén. Thompson, who was in the United States at the time, never returned to Yucatán. He wrote about his research and investigations of the Maya culture in a book People of the Serpent published in 1932. He died in New Jersey in 1935. In 1944 the Mexican Supreme Court ruled that Thompson had broken no laws and returned Chichen Itza to his heirs. The Thompsons
                            sold the hacienda to tourism pioneer Fernando Barbachano Peon.[37]

                           <p>The Colosseum in Rome is a massive amphitheater built in 80 AD. It was used for gladiatorial contests and public spectacles.
                            The ambitious project began under Emperor Vespasian and reached completion under his son, Emperor Titus, in A.D. 80. Ancient sources record a solemn inauguration lasting 100 days, filled with elaborate spectacles aimed at winning public favor and celebrating the Flavian dynasty’s generosity.
                             The Colosseum stood as the most grandiose symbol of Roman power, shaped by the Flavians’ desire to entertain the masses and reinforce imperial prestige. In A.D. 64, a disastrous fire ravaged the city of Rome for nine days, leaving it in ruins. When Emperor Nero rebuilt much of the city, he reserved 
                             a central expanse for his luxurious new palace, the Domus Aurea (Golden House). Dominating its entrance stood a towering 37-meter-tall bronze statue of Nero himself, and surrounding the complex was a private park featuring an artificial lake.
