    Petra was once a thriving city and a key trading hub...
    Petra, also known as the "Rose City" due to the color of the stone it is carved from, is an ancient city located in southern Jordan. It was established as early as 312 BC as the capital city of the Nabataean Kingdom.
    The Nabataeans were skilled traders and engineers who built a thriving civilization in the harsh desert. Petra became a crucial hub for trade routes linking Arabia, Egypt, and the Mediterranean. The city was known for its sophisticated water management system, which included dams, cisterns, and tunnels to control flash floods and provide water to its inhabitants.
    One of Petra’s most famous structures is Al-Khazneh (The Treasury), believed to be the mausoleum of a Nabataean king. The city’s architecture blends Eastern traditions with Hellenistic styles, carved directly into rose-colored cliffs.
    After being annexed by the Roman Empire in 106 AD, Petra continued to flourish but gradually declined due to changes in trade routes and several major earthquakes. By the Middle Ages, it was largely forgotten by the Western world, until its rediscovery in 1812 by Swiss explorer Johann Ludwig Burckhardt.
    Today, Petra is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the New Seven Wonders of the World, attracting millions of visitors for its breathtaking beauty and remarkable historical significance.
